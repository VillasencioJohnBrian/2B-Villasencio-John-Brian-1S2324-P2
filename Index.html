                <h1>The Hot Bake Shop story</h1>
                The story of the worldâ€™s most famous Hot Bake Shop begins in 2023 on a , cobblestone corner in the West Village where Hot Bake Shop opened its doors for the first time. The sweet smell of cakes and cookies and pies and pudding tumbled out, wafting down the streets, beckoning all in.
                Our red velvet cupcakes became iconic and people lined up around the block for our banana pudding. There was even talk of filipino guys becoming cupcake guys. Bakery was a destination for locals and tourists alike.
                It was time for us to open the cupboards and share our magic with the world. Our neighborhood bakery found its way into new neighborhoods near and far, we wrote cookbooks and helped people all over celebrate their most important moments.
                And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: open early and close late, a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday.
