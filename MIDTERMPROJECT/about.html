            The story of the worldâ€™s most famous Hot Bake Shop begins in 2023 on a cobblestone corner in the <br>West
            Village where Hot Bake Shop opened its doors for the first time.The sweet smell of cakes and cookies and pies <br>and pudding tumbled out, wafting down the streets, beckoning all in.
            Our red velvet cupcakes became iconic and people <br>lined up around the block for our banana pudding. There was even talk of filipino guys becoming cupcake guys. Bakery was a destination for locals and tourists alike.
            It was time for us to open the cupboards and share our magic with the world. Our <br> neighborhood bakery found its way into new neighborhoods near and far, we wrote cookbooks and helped people all <br>over celebrate their most important moments.
            And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: <br>open early and close late, a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and <br>our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday.
